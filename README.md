# Chat Amongst Yourselves: A Angular Client Side Chat App

* * *

Picture this: You're in a meeting (or a class) with your friend, and things are getting a bit stagnant.  Your mind wanders.  And you get lost about what's going on.  You wish you could just chat about the finer points of the topic at hand discreetly in the moment, but texting would be rude.  What to do?

Try Chat Amongst Yourselves!  The easy and discreet way to stay on task!  Simply fire it up and ask questions away on your buddy's computer.

I built this client side chat application with no storage whatsoever, so if you need to cut the conversation short and look productive, all you have to do is refresh the page and viola!  Conversation gone!

Have fun, stay on task and be a superstar, the Chat Amongst Yourselves way!
